# BookshelfNG for Unraid

This repository publishes the standalone BookshelfNG Unraid Docker template.
**Built on .NET 10 LTS**, BookshelfNG is a Snapetech NG fork of Bookshelf for
ebook and audiobook library management and acquisition. It works independently;
SeerrNG integration is optional.

> **Final release:** BookshelfNG `0.4.21.71` is the final source release. The
> legacy Unraid template has not yet switched to ChaptarrNG. The latest
> published ChaptarrNG release is `v0.9.977`, which accepts migration-158
> SQLite and rejects older source schemas. An unreleased older-schema SQLite
> upgrade path and one-schema PostgreSQL converter are under review in
> [ChaptarrNG PR #131](https://github.com/snapetech-org/chaptarrng/pull/131);
> exact-head platform and PostgreSQL checks are running on `e67f28ed`.
> BookshelfNG's fail-closed publishing gate is under review in
> [PR #148](https://github.com/snapetech-org/bookshelfng/pull/148). No new
> release or image will be published while operator-data migration, rollback,
> and installer acceptance remain open. An isolated Docker image-switch smoke
> passed with an empty database and rollback; populated data and the Community
> Apps template update flow remain untested.

## Existing installations

Keep the current BookshelfNG image until you are ready to migrate. The legacy
Community Apps template on `main` still points to BookshelfNG. A transition
candidate keeps the existing BookshelfNG entry, appdata path, port, media and
download mappings, user IDs, timezone, and Hardcover settings while switching
to the standard ChaptarrNG image. It is not published and must remain on its
feature branch until the application release and Unraid update-flow gates
pass. The XML and settings-preservation check passed; run
`python3 scripts/test-transition-template.py` to repeat it. Read the
[BookshelfNG-to-ChaptarrNG migration guide](https://github.com/snapetech-org/bookshelfng/blob/main/docs/migrate-from-bookshelfng-to-chaptarrng.md),
upgrade BookshelfNG to `.71`, stop the service, and keep an independent
appdata backup before switching. New installations should use the
[ChaptarrNG Unraid template](https://github.com/snapetech-org/chaptarrng-unraid).
For a manual BookshelfNG install needed to inspect or roll back an existing
library, use [the legacy template XML](templates/bookshelfng.xml); it installs
`ghcr.io/snapetech-org/bookshelfng:main`.

- Map persistent appdata to `/config` and your media to `/data`.
- Map downloads to `/download`, matching your download client's container paths.
- Set a personal Hardcover API token in `HARDCOVER_AUTH` or BookshelfNG settings.
- Open the web interface on port 8787 and configure indexers and download clients.
- One instance can manage ebooks and audiobooks. SeerrNG can use two service
  entries with the same URL and API key when requesting both formats.
- Existing Readarr or softcover databases require migration before using the
  Hardcover image; changing the image tag alone is not a migration.
